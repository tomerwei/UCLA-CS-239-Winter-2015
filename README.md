CS 239, Class Project Part A, UCLA, Winter 2015

Part A Project (Due 2/9, 11:59PM): Automated Debugging of Program Stack Traces
1. Use the ASM bytecode instrumentation toolkit to log call stacks over time and produce a calling context tree.
2. Annotate call stacks with spectra information â€“ the number of times that the stack appear in failure traces vs. successful traces.
3. Use R Studio to measure different fault suspicious scores.
4. Count the static metrics of your choice.
5. Measure correlation between the metrics and the suspiciousness scores.
6. Use linear regression to see how each suspicious score is related to metrics.
