Original source code for versions of Ant, unpacked and prepared for
compilation.

The Vn directories found here may include a file named "build.txt". This file
lists any modifications that were necessary to freeze dependencies and make that
particular version build successfully. The same changes will need to be made in
the event that you want to rebuild a version from a source tarball in the
originals directory.

To build a version, including its tests, execute 'build.sh compile-tests' in
the base directory (some early versions may require 'build_unix.sh compiletests').

Every version has a JUnit test suite in the base directory that combines all of
the JUnit tests available in the version. That test suite can be used as the
argument to a test runner, without requiring the use of the build script.

Also found in the base directory is a script named "runTests.sh", which will run
the JUnit tests directly though JUnit. It expects as arguments the name of the
test runner to be used and any arguments to be passed to that test runner. Do
not include the name of the test suite as an argument. For example, to use the
regular text output test runner, you would issue the following command:
    runTests.sh junit.textui.TestRunner
To get a list of the test case names, you could issue this command:
    runTests.sh junit.textui.SelectiveTestRunner -names

This script is only intended to demonstrate how to set up the classpath and
run the test suite, it will likely need to be modified or replaced to support
automated testing.
