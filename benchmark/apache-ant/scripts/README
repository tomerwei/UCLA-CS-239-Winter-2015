Prior to the installation of ant program, you need to set the following
variables and classpath: 
 
    - ant path: ant MUST be added to path BEFORE /usr/local/bin or a default 
      version installed on the network will be used.

    - experiment_root :  
      Set environment variable experiment_root to point to the parent directory 
      of the subject directory by typing "setenv experiment_root <path>"
      For example, assume you have a subject directory "apache-ant" and you 
      locate it under /cs_machine/exp_group/experiments, then you would give 
      the command:

        setenv experiment_root /cs_machine/exp_group/experiments

    - JAVA_HOME : /usr/local/common/j2sdk1.4.1 (adjust this to your environment) 
      If you need to change JAVA_HOME, then you also have to change the following
      file: ~apache-ant/versions.alt/orig/v0/ant/build_unix.sh.
	

    - CLASSPATH : 

	For v0,
	${experiment_root}/apache-ant/source/ant/build/ant/testcases:
	${experiment_root}/apache-ant/source/ant/build/ant/classes:. 

	For v1 and upward,
	${experiment_root}/apache-ant/source/ant/build/testcases:
	${experiment_root}/apache-ant/source/ant/build/classes:.

1. Installation.

   - original version: 
        install.sh orig version_number
        (version_number: 0, 1, ..., or 8)

   - seeded version: 
	install_seeded.sh version_number  --> used when you build fault matrix.
        (version_number: 1, 2, ..., or 8)
					       
2. Run tests.

   - TestScripts directory contains testscripts that run test case.
     The first line of a testscript file defines CLASSPATH, so you need
     to modify this line to adjust your environment. 

   - Copy testscript file into ../source/ant/ and run testscript in that 
     directory.
